# Announcement


The [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.aau.dk/) invites students, faculty, and the public to join us for the **Earth Day 2026 Event**. The theme for this year is "*Data Science for Climate Research*".  

The event is a day-long celebration of the importance and challenges of communicating climate change research to the public. *The event is open to researchers, students, and anyone who is interested in learning more about this pressing topic*. 

The event will take place on [April 22](https://www.earthday.org/), 2026, at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/), Denmark.

## Event Program

The event features:

- **Climate change research presentations** by invited speakers. You will get to hear about the latest findings and methods in this field, and how they can help us understand and address the complex issues of climate change. The talks are tailored for a general audience, so *no previous experience on the topics is needed*.

- **A climate-related hackathon** to design the best way to communicate to the general public. The theme for this year means that the best solutions will come from cross-disciplinary collaboration between participants with different sets of skills. So, convince all your friends to join your team. Mark at registration if you already have a team or if you want to be assigned to one. *You don't need to be an expert to join*, just bring your enthusiasm and willingness to learn and work with others!

    - Free coffe ☕️, cake 🥮, pizza 🍕, and drinks 🥤 for all hackathon participants.
 
- **A climate change-related meme-competition**. Show off your sense of humour and your knowledge of climate change by creating and sharing memes that are funny, informative, and relevant. The best memes will be voted by the experts panel and displayed on the event's website.
