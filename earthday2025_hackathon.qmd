# Hackathon

Welcome to the Earth Day 2025 Hackathon! This hackathon is part of Earth Day 2025, an event that aims to bring together researchers and all interested to discuss the latest research on climate change, its impacts, and ways to communicate them to the general public. The hackathon is an opportunity for participants to work together to develop innovative ways of disseminating the causes and effects of climate change.

## Instructions

### The challenge

Your aim is to develop a data dashboard that can be used to communicate the causes and/or effects of climate change to the general public. The dashboard should be engaging, informative, and easy to understand, and should be based on true scientific data.

### The data

You can use any data you like to develop your dashboard, the only restriction is that it has to be *true data publicly available*. 

Examples of data sources include:

- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/climate-change)
- [IPCC Data Distribution Centre](https://www.ipcc-data.org/)
- [NOAA Climate Data Online](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)
- [NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)

### The task

1. Form a team of 1-4 people. 
   - You can work alone or in a team. 
   - If you are looking for a team, please let the organizers know and we will help you find one.
2. Choose the data you want to use. You can combine data from different sources if you like.
3. Develop a dashboard to communicate the causes and/or effects of climate change. You are free to use any programming language or software you like. But we recommend using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for the dashboard. More information on Quarto can be found below. 
4. Prepare a short pitch/presentation to showcase your dashboard to the judges.
5. Submit the code to generate your dashboard in the GitHub classroom repository. 
   - You can use the GitHub classroom repository created for this event [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/kHmR41Gj).
   - If you are not familiar with GitHub, please let the organizers know and we will help you.

### Examples and more information 

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is a scientific and technical publishing system that allows you to create documents, presentations, websites, and dashboards using R, Python, or Julia. It is a great tool for creating interactive dashboards and is easy to use. You can find more information on Quarto [here](https://quarto.org).

For more information on how to create dashboards with Quarto, you can check out the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/) and the video tutorials [here](https://youtu.be/HW7QbqI4fH0?si=aG2Sk_hucVNAzFhv) and [here](https://youtu.be/_VGJIPRGTy4?si=ituI4qh82WSA5mYk).

You can also find a lot of examples of dashboards created with Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#dashboards). If you click on the </> icon in the top right corner of each dashboard, you can see the code used to create it. 

As inspiration, for a climate dashboard you can look at the [following](https://everval.github.io/Dashboard-Breaching-1.5C/).


### The judging

The judging will be based on the following criteria:

- **Relevance**: How relevant is the dashboard to the topic of climate change?
- **Engagement**: How engaging is the dashboard?
- **Informative**: How informative is the dashboard?
- **Ease of understanding**: How easy is it to understand the dashboard?
