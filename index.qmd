This is the website for climate-related research at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/). 

It hosts the [Earth Day Events](index.qmd#earth-day-events) and [Climate Econometrics Research Projects](index.qmd#climate-econometrics-research-projects) at the University.

## [Earth Day Events](earthday2024.qmd)

The [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://earthdayalliance.com/earth-day-the-story/) organizes the yearly "Mathematics and Statistics for Climate Change Research" events to commemmorate Earth Day. The events consists of a day of learning and exploring how Mathematics and Data Science can contribute to Climate Change Research, help us understand and predict our future climate, and design mitigation policies.

The events are open to the public and are free of charge. Moreover, drinks and pizza are provided to all participants at the hackathon.

The next Earth Day will be on April 22, 2024. For more information about the next event, follow [this link](earthday2024.qmd).
