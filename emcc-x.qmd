The 10th Conference on Econometric Models of Climate Change (EMCC-X) will be held at Aalborg University, Denmark, on August 20-21, 2026.

The conference brings together economists, econometricians, climate scientists, statisticians, and policy researchers to improve our understanding of climate change, its impacts, and effective policy solutions. The EMCC conference series was established in 2016 and has been supported by themed issues of the Journal of Econometrics, Energy Economics, the International Journal of Forecasting, and Advances in Econometrics. Previous iterations of the conference are linked [here](https://sites.google.com/view/emccconference/conferences).

## Call for Papers

The Conference aims to promote an interdisciplinary approach to the detection and attribution of climate change, econometric estimates of socio-economic and financial climate impacts, as well as policy evaluation. 

We solicit submissions of papers whose novelty stems from the applications, development, and introduction of econometric methods to models of climate change - inviting papers using econometric methods to analyse climate data, as well as econometric studies of socio-economic climate impacts and policy. Papers that present challenges in climate science, where statistical methods can provide analytical insights, are especially welcome.

Please submit your abstract or full paper by **March 26, 2026** via the following form: [https://forms.gle/nkkLP5JX9GJSr9ZF9](https://forms.gle/nkkLP5JX9GJSr9ZF9). 

Notifications of acceptance will be sent by **May 1, 2026**.
